Hello, I'm Ezgi. 

I am a student of Turkish Aeronautical Association University Electrical and Electronics Engineering and Anadolu University Computer Programming.

I was born on November 7, 2000 in Ankara.

I started playing strategy games with my father when I was 4-5 years old and this is how my journey started. 

As a hardcore player, "why am I not in this industry?" 

I started to develop myself.

The game projects I do have nothing to do with my school education.
